Haskell OCR
===========

Implementing simple OCR tool in haskell, performing character recognition on an image that many other OCR tools fail on due to very low resolution.

The digital source image is of very low resolution, but letters are pixel perfect. This is an opportunity to do OCR via simple boolean matching.

The code is not fully completed, but rather the result of my first live-coding project. You can find it at: http://codinguncut.com/ocr-text-recognition-data-driven-programming/
